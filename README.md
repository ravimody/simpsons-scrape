This was a really quick attempt at scaping reddit posts on r/thesimpsons to find how the submissions from different seasons have channged over the years. 

I used tags to grab the season number, without realizing tags are a relatively new feature. Oh well, maybe I'll revisit this in the future. Or, what could be cool, is trying to infer the season from people quoting the episode.
